## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

i now understand how to:

Structure an article using semantic HTML tags.

Use the <time> element correctly.

Apply headings and paragraphs with meaningful class names.

Import and apply custom fonts in CSS using @font-face.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article>
    <h4 class="label">Learning</h4>
    <p class="date">Published <time datetime="21">21</time> Dec <time datetime="2023">2023</time></p>

    <h1 class="title">HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
    <p class="caption">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation</p>
  </article>
```
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: figtreeFont ;
    src: url(./assets//fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}

@font-face {
    font-family: figtreeFontitalic ;
    src: url(./assets//fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}
```




### Continued development

I'm currently focusing on improving my front-end development skills by building more real-world projects. Iâ€™m working on becoming more confident with:

Responsive web design

Advanced CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, animations)

JavaScript fundamentals

Working with design systems and UI libraries

I also plan to start learning popular JavaScript frameworks like React to build more dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
